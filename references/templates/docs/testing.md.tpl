# Testing policy

Tests are executable evidence that a meaningful regression becomes visible before delivery. Optimize for risk-adjusted signal over the test's lifetime, not test count, line coverage, or assertion volume. Repository-wide entry commands live in the root [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md); this document owns test selection and topology.

## Test selection

Name the behavior or invariant at risk before writing a test. Choose the lowest boundary that can observe it with production-like composition: pure decisions belong in unit tests, module contracts and stateful boundaries in integration tests, and public entry points or cross-system flows in end-to-end tests. One behavior has one primary evidence home; add defense in depth only when a public contract, security boundary, migration, escaped incident, or similarly costly risk justifies the duplication.

| Risk shape | Primary evidence |
|---|---|
| Pure logic, decisions, and state transitions | Focused unit tests at the owning code area |
| Module contracts, persistence, files, queues, or framework composition | Integration tests with real owned modules and only unstable external boundaries replaced |
| Public CLI/API/UI entry points and cross-system flows | End-to-end tests through the shipped entry point with externally inspected results |
| Security boundaries, migrations, and escaped incidents | The lowest sufficient primary test plus narrowly justified defense in depth |

## Test topology

__TEST_TOPOLOGY__

Follow the ecosystem's discoverable convention rather than forcing a universal tree. Colocated unit tests are valid where idiomatic; cross-module and system tests belong in clearly named repository-level roots. Keep a fixture beside the test that owns it and promote it to shared infrastructure only when multiple contracts genuinely share it.

## Evidence rules

- Assert observable outcomes: return values, errors, persisted state, files, process exit status, rendered output, or externally visible side effects. Internal call counts and private ordering are evidence only when they are themselves a contract.
- Test the real entry path where packaging, process setup, configuration, or wiring can fail. A hand-wired harness cannot prove the shipped entry point works.
- Mock only expensive or non-deterministic boundaries such as the network, clock, or an external API; keep owned composition downstream of that boundary real.
- Select representative equivalence classes, boundaries, invalid inputs, state transitions, and recovery points instead of enumerating incidental examples.
- A regression test fails for the escaped behavior before the fix and passes afterward. It proves the cause, not merely that some nearby output changed.
- When a change should preserve a file or state, assert it remains byte-identical or semantically identical as the contract requires.

## Maintenance budget

- Coverage reports locate unobserved code; they are not a target and do not establish test quality.
- Remove or merge tests when their behavior disappears, another test becomes the primary evidence, or they constrain implementation without protecting a contract.
- A flaky test is a broken signal. Fix its uncontrolled boundary or quarantine it with an owner and repair condition; never normalize blind retries.
- Keep the fast path focused enough for local use. Expensive techniques such as fuzzing, mutation, visual regression, load testing, and large environment matrices require a repository risk that pays for their continuing cost.

## When a test is required

Every behavior change adds or updates the smallest test set that proves its affected contract. Every bug fix carries a regression test unless the failure is already deterministically reproduced by an existing test; document that existing evidence when no new test is needed. Documentation-only and mechanical changes use the relevant semantic review and gates rather than manufacturing behavior tests.
